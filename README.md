This repository is created to organize the many repositories used in our Multiple-Camera Blind Assistive System.

## Purpose
The Assistive System contains multiple software components which are deployed on multiple computing platforms. The following is the list of repositories used in this project.

1. Software for the Raspbery Pi component of the Assistive System- https://github.com/harish32k/raspberry-pi-assistive-device
2. Code for the Android Application https://github.com/harish32k/Blind-Assistant-app
3. Intermediary API server https://github.com/harish32k/central-api
4. API for Object Detection https://github.com/harish32k/object-detect-api
5. API for Scene Description https://github.com/harish32k/caption-api
6. API for Image Depth https://github.com/harish32k/depth-api
7. Code for the Arduino module for Obstacle Detection https://github.com/harish32k/arduino-obstacle-detection
